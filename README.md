# Kanban Svelte

This is a kanban board application that is built on Svelte.

# Developing

```
npm run dev
```

The command above runs both frontend and json-server. If you would like to run only frontend use `npm run vite`, or `npm run server` for json-server.

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab

npm run dev -- --open

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
````

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
